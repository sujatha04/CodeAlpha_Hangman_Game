# CodeAlpha_Hangman_Game
# 🎮 Hangman Game (Python)

## 📌 Project Goal
Create a simple text-based **Hangman game** where the player guesses a word one letter at a time.  

---

## 📝 Features
- Predefined list of 5 words (no external files or APIs).
- Randomly selects a word for each game.
- Player guesses one letter at a time.
- Maximum **6 incorrect guesses** allowed.
- Displays progress as underscores `_ _ _` until letters are guessed.
- Simple console input/output (no graphics or audio).

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Used
- **random** → to pick a random word  
- **while loop** → to keep the game running until win/loss  
- **if-else** → to check guesses and game status  
- **strings & lists** → for storing and updating the word display
