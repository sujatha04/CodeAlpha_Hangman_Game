# CodeAlpha_Hangman_Game
# Hangman Game (Python)

# Project Goal
Create a simple text-based **Hangman game** where the player guesses a word one letter at a time.  

# Features
- Predefined list of 5 words (no external files or APIs).
- Randomly selects a word for each game.
- Player guesses one letter at a time.
- Maximum **6 incorrect guesses** allowed.
- Displays progress as underscores `_ _ _` until letters are guessed.
- Simple console input/output (no graphics or audio).

# Key Concepts Used
- **random** → to pick a random word  
- **while loop** → to keep the game running until win/loss  
- **if-else** → to check guesses and game status  
- **strings & lists** → for storing and updating the word display  

# How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.  
2. Save the script as `hangman.py`.  
3. Open a terminal/command prompt and run:  
   ```bash
   python hangman.py
